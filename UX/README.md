# st21-chestX

<b>ChestX</b> is a <b>TechLabs Berlin</b> project that aims to detect COVID-19 infection by processing chest X-ray images. To support medical decision making, the ChestX team wants to apply AI techniques for object detection & classification, as well as data science methods. Metadata provided alongside the X-ray images can be analysed to provide doctors with more meaningful diagnostic assistance.
