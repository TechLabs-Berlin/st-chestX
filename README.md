# st21-chestX
<b>ChestX</b> is a <b>TechLabs Berlin</b> project that aims to detect COVID-19 infection by processing chest X-ray images. To support medical decision making, the ChestX team wants to apply AI techniques for object detection & classification, as well as data science methods. Metadata provided alongside the X-ray images can be analysed to provide doctors with more meaningful diagnostic assistance.

## Data set
The COVID-19 image data collection is a public open dataset of chest X-ray and CT images of patients which are positive or suspected of COVID-19 or other viral and bacterial pneumonias. The project was started and is maintained by Joseph Paul Cohen, Paul Morrison, and Lan Dao from the University of Montreal.
Please, watch the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ineWmqfelEQ) for a quick project introduction, or check out there [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11597) for more details about the [data set](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset).

This COVID-19 data set is linked as submodule to this git project. <br>Run the following code to download the submodule:
```git submodule update --init --recursive```
<br>To update the submodul run:
```git submodule update --remote --merge```
